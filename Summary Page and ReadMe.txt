Final Project Summary
Team Members: 
Jonathan Fuchs, Adam Schneider, Melissa Wu


Project Description:
Our project involves expanding on the spellchecker assignment to build a more robust tool and to mimic the functionalities of a word processor. The user has the option to choose from three different umbrella functionalities. The first option is to access and use  GUI to create his or her own document, edit the document real-time through functions such as highlighting and deleting, conduct a spellchecker analysis, and more (please refer to the code for more functions). The second option is the read in an existing file and get an advanced text analysis that includes readability, spelling, consonant, vowel, and consonant analysis. The third option is to create a data table text file based on user-inputed columns and data. We learned a great deal during this project and were excited to use this new knowledge to expand on a former assignment!


Work Breakdown:
Jonathan: Provided the base code from the spellchecker assignment and wrote the code for the GUI, which included the TextDocumentUI and PatternChecker classes.
Adam: Wrote the code for conducting Spellchecker analysis (i.e. readability and spellchecking) including the Spelling Analysis and TextFormatting classes.
Melissa: Write the code for conducting vowel, consonant, and character analysis (i.e. voweConsonantAnalysis class) and a function to create a data table text file (i.e. DataToTextFile)
